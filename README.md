Advent of Code 2021 in clumsy APL

I like the state that 01.apl is now in.
I plan to edit later days to catch up and offer more guidance.

Only test vector data files are included.
Get the actual puzzle input data from https://adventofcode.com/2021

Disclaimer: I encountered APL around 1980, long before 
many of the fancy features appeared that modern APLs now have.
There will very very likely exist much shorter, and/or much more efficient, solutions elsewhere.

All code was developed with the non-commercial 18.0 version
from https://www.dyalog.com (on either macOS 12 or Win 10).
